#### Work Stuff

I'm a software engineer on the Commercial Software Engineering team at Microsoft. My job is to code-with Microsoft customers and help them tackle their toughest technical problems, both in the cloud and on the edge.

As part of that job, I get the opportunity to work with many Microsoft product teams which enables me to give back to the developer community through:

- Providing product feedback
- Sharing reusable resources and assets
- [Writing about projects](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cse/) and how my team and I unblock customers

You can learn more about my team and how we operate [here](https://github.com/microsoft/code-with-engineering-playbook)!
